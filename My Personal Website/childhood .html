        <h2>Memorable Childhood Experiences</h2>
        <p>When I was young I was a very playful child who enjoyed playing and exploring in very many things, there was a timee that I found an old radio that had been thrown away and dediced to see what was inside that was the start of my love for technology. As I continued to grow my fasination of technology only continued to grow since my mother was well off I had multiple chance to interact with gajets and I then discoverd games on her phone and started playing it was and old version game called snake ,where the objective was to make a snake eat a certain red ball and your supposed to be careful so that the snake diddn't bite itself , over the years I continued playing countless games in a hope to create one that others may enjoy as well .</p>
